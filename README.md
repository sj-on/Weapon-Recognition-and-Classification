<h1>Weapon Recognition and Classification</h1>
<br>
<p>This tool, built using <strong>Darknet</strong> and <strong>YOLO</strong>, aims at helping Policemen (can be extended to CCTVs too), to identify a potentially dangerous situation like a person holding a deadly weapon and is trained especially for detection of the presence of GUNS in an image. All the files required for this tool to work are present here, in this repository, except the .weights file, which got generated after rigorous training of the model and <a href = "https://drive.google.com/file/d/17z3LOJDlKkTxkcryidLWWZ3DeIRtTlXc/view?usp=sharing" target = "_blank">can be downloaded from here</a>.</p>
<br>
<p>This tool has been trained well to work with low-resolution images, therefore images from CCTV cameras won't be an issue. The tool is being made <strong>Open-Source</strong> and hence, can be extended to work as a real-time Weapon Classifier, after making a few modifications to the source code. </p>
