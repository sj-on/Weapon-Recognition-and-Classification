# Weapon Recognition and Classification
<br>
This tool, built using **Darknet** and **YOLO**, aims at helping Policemen, to identify a potentially dangerous situation like a person holding a weapon and is trained especially for detection of the existence of GUNS in an image. All the files required for this tool to work are present here, in this repository, except the .weights file, which got generated after rigorous training of the model and [can be downloaded from here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17z3LOJDlKkTxkcryidLWWZ3DeIRtTlXc/view?usp=sharing).  
<br>
This tool has been trained well to work with low-resolution images, therefore images from CCTV cameras won't be an issue. The tool is made **Open-Source** and hence, can be extended to work as a real-time Weapon Classifier, after making a few modifications to the source code.
<br>
> ## Steps to make use of the Tool
> 1. Clone the repository. Do not forget to download the [.weights file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17z3LOJDlKkTxkcryidLWWZ3DeIRtTlXc/view?usp=sharing).
> 2. Open Terminal/CMD in the same directory as the main.py file. (python main.py)
> 3. Follow the instructions given in the program.
<br>
For the project to be fully functional, make sure that you have latest version of **Python** installed on your system.
